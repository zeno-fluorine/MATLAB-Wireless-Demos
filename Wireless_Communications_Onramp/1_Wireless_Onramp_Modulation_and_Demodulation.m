% "What you see in the scatter plot is the ideal 16-QAM constellationâ€”16 complex-valued symbols arranged in a square, with each symbol equally spaced from its neighbors. The greater the separation between points, the better the error rate performance. Later, when you add noise to the simulation, you'll see the received observations depart from this ideal configuration."
